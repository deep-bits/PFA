A Shiny app is just like any typical web application. It runs on a server and lets you interact via the user interface. In the minimalist version of any Shiny app there are 4 things to begin with.

1.  Import Shiny R library

2.  Define User interface

3.  Define Server

4.  Run Shiny application

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  The step one requires you to load shiny library.

<!-- -->

    library(shiny)

2.  Call an R function that will render HTML code on client application (Web browser)

<!-- -->

    ui <- shiny's_html_generating_functioncall(
        # Choose a layout
        # Choose what to display in main panel & how to handle input
        some_input_function("id_of_object","label","default_value"),
        some_other_function("",...)
    )

3.  Define a server function that takes HTML input from user interface and shows HTML output on user interface

<!-- -->

    server <- function(input, output){
        # Render some html output
        # You can use exception handling here to handle inappropriate inputs
    }

4.  Run the Shiny app, by binding user interface with server functionality

<!-- -->

    shinyApp(ui, server)

#### Once the server is up and running, you can publish your app and it will then be hosted so that others can use it.
